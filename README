Form-Processor-Model-DBIC

This is a DBIx::Class model for Form::Processor. It provides a
database interface to Form::Processor, and allows the user to
automatically save their template HTML form data to a database.
It allows automatic, easy creation of single and multiple select 
lists based on database tables. A Form::Processor::Model::DBIC
form is a Perl class, and very customizable.

This module requires Form::Processor and DBIx::Class. Many users
will probably use it with Catalyst and Catalyst::Plugin::Form::Processor,
though they are not required.

This is version 0.02
